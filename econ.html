            <p><b>What is Macroeconomic?</b><br>Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that examines an economy through a broad lens. This covers factors such as unemployment, GDP, and inflation. Furthermore, macroeconomists create models that explain the correlations between these variables.></p>

            <p><b>How Markets Work?</b><br>Market economies, command economies, and mixed economies are the three types of economies that are studied in economics. The United States and many other capitalist nations operate on the tenets of a market economy, sometimes known as a free-market economy.></p>

            <p><b>What advantages can market economies offer?</b><br> A market economy offers a number of significant advantages. This sort of economy makes sure that commodities, services, and products are created in accordance with consumer demand. Businesses will try to create the desired goods and services as effectively as possible since consumers are prepared to pay a premium price for them. Additionally, a market economy encourages healthy rivalry among firms, which leads to higher-quality products being offered to customers at rates they are willing to pay.</p>

            <p><b>Utility</b><br>Utility is a word used in economics  to assess the worth or value of an item or service. Utility is defined as the entire satisfaction
                or benefit gained from consuming an item
                or service. Consumer utility maximization is
                commonly assumed in economic theories
                based on rational choice. </p>

                <p><strong>FACT:</strong>The forces of supply and demand are used in market economies to set the right prices and quantities for the majority of products and services.</p>
                <p><b>How Do You Calculate Economic Utility?</b><br>
                    Even though there is no straightforward way to evaluate the utility of a specific commodity for an individual customer, utility can be estimated through indirect observation. For example, if a consumer is ready to pay $1 for a bottle of water but not $1.50, economists can confidently conclude that a bottle of water has economic usefulness anywhere between $1 and $1.50. However, due to the number of variables inherent in a normal consumer's selections, this becomes challenging in practice.</p>
