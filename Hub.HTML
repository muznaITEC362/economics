            <h2>What is economics?</h2>
            <p>When it comes to the definition of economics, it becomes very complicated because there are more than five different definitions.<br>
             However, the simplest definition will be that "Economics is the study of people in the ordinary business of life." (Marshal, 1890).<br>
             In another way, the study of economics focuses on how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity <br>
             and how certain decisions influence our behavior.</p>

            <p><b>Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics</b><br>
                Microeconomics and macroeconomics are the two branches of economics. Microeconomics, the smaller picture,<br>
                 is the study of individual and corporate decisions, whereas macroeconomics, which is the wide picture, <br>
                 is the study of national and government decisions.</p>

            <h2>Key Terms you need to know :</h2>
            <p>1.<b>supply and Demand</b> <br>
                Supply and demand are critical in understanding what is going on in many aspects of our life. They appear to be two simple phrases, yet they are crucial to understanding economics.</p>
                <p>Supply is the market's ability to generate an item or service.<br>
                    Deman is the market's willingness to acquire the commodity or service</p>

            <p><b>Scarcity</b><br>
                According to investopedia.com, scarcity is "the basic economic dilemma that develops when individuals have boundless demands but limited resources."<br>
                The concept of Scarcity is an essential idea to grasp because it allows us to assign a monetary value to a product or service. <br>
                The rarer a resource is and the greater the demand for it, the more costly it will be.</p>

            <p><b>Inflation</b>, defined as the general increase in the cost of goods and services over time, may have a significant impact on consumers. Goods will become more expensive.</p>
            <p><b>Recession</b> is the period between a peak of economic activity and its lowest point. The decline in economic activity must be significant, spread across the economy and last more than a few months.</p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Purchasing power</b><br>
                The number of products or services that a certain amount of money can buy at any given time is referred to as purchasing power. Inflation might cause it to become worse over time. This is because growing prices reduce the amount of goods and services available. Purchasing power is sometimes referred to as a currency's purchasing power.</p>

                <p><b>Time value of money</b><br>
                    Any student who wishes to handle their money efficiently, this economics term will help you. According to the time value of money theory, a dollar now is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. The time value of money directs our actions in numerous ways. In addition to pushing us to invest our money to beat market interest rates, it also instructs us to consider inflationary principles.
